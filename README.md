# 16PXLS

Born out of a need for an icon set that would align well in vertical and horizontal lists. Great for navigation, buttons, headings or lists. If you are obsessed with things lining up, then this icon set is perfect for you!

## Documentation

Reference for each icon can be accessed from `dist/docs/index.html`.

#### Css

Include `16pxls.css` in your `<head>` tags, or `@import url('');` in your Css.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/16pxls.css">` **or** `@import url('16pxls.css');`

Add the class `.icon-*` replacing the `*` with the name of the icon you want to use.

`<span class=".icon-Skull"></span>`

This will add the icon as an SVG background image.

#### Font

Font has been built using [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/), within the `dist/fonts/` folder you'll find the `demo.html` and `readme.txt` detailing how to use it.
